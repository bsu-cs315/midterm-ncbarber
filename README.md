## Reflection

I think that this project I took a big leap into these different outside tools that I could use in order to make some really nice assets for a project. 
I had a lot of fun working on making little tunes as well as animations and working with particles.
Overall this iteration showed me that I am able to figure out a lot of the ideas that I want to do for a basic game like this.
I am really looking forward to building more things that I but this level of ideas and creativity into. 
I definetly have started to build more confidence in my ideas, and I'm looking forward to being able to do things like game jams, and this one week project next week!

## Juice

First Item added for juice was particles for the character, as well as particles for the coins. 
I thought that throwing those in added to the movement, and made the coins a bit more interesting.
The second item that I added for some "juiciness" was a screenshake whenever the character uses their rocket jump!
I thought that the rocketjump was sort of a key idea when coming up with it, so being able to spice it up a little just made sense.


## Self-Evaluation

- [X] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [X] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [X] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game itself.
- [X] C-5: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of T or less.
- [X] C-6: The game includes a player-controlled character, implemented as a <code>KinematicBody</code> and positioned in a conventional, <code>TileMap</code>-based, 2D-platforming world.
- [X] C-7: The player's character can move left and right, with its movement bounded by impassable tiles.
- [X] C-8: The player's character can jump up and onto tiles.
- [X] C-9: The player's character falls down when walking off a ledge.
- [X] C-10: Include a full player experience loop: title, gameplay, end.
- [X] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.
- [X] B-2: The source code and project structure comply with our adopted style guides.
- [X] B-3: There is a sprite element in the level that the player can interact with, such as a collectible, an enemy, a book, or a switch.
- [X] B-4: The camera follows the character through a world that is larger than one screen.
- [X] B-5: Include sound effects and music.
- [X] B-6: Include a HUD that tracks game-appropriate data such as score or time remaining.
- [X] B-7: Include a clear example of <em>juice</em> and describe it in the <code>README.md</code>.
- [X] A-1: Generate neither warnings nor errors at runtime.
- [X] A-2: Include two clear examples of <em>juice</em> and describe them in the <code>README.md</code>.
- [X] A-3: Earn two stars.
- [X] ⭐ Animate the main character using either <code>AnimatedSprite</code> or cutout animation
- [X] ⭐ Include parallax scrolling in the background.
- [X] ⭐ Include tiles that can be passed in one direction, such as being able to jump up through a tile and land atop it.

With all of these requirments, after looking over all of them, I believe that I have done more than enough require to recieve an A for this iteration.
